        <div class="text">
            <p>Welcome to Group 2's kitchen! We are a small group of friends living together in Montreal who share a passion for baking.</p><br>
            <p>What started as a simple hobby has now grown into a love for experimenting with different flavors and techniques.</p><br>
            <p>We constantly try to make new recipes and reimagine classic ones by tweaking ingredients, and adding our unique twists.</p><br>
            <p>Our goal is to inspire fellow bakers and food lovers by sharing our creations.</p><br>
            <p>Baking is more than just a hobby for us—it's a way to express our creativity, challenge ourselves,</p><br>
            <p>and, most importantly, have fun together. We hope you enjoy our journey and try a few of our recipes for yourself!</p>

        <h1 class="about_heading">How It Started</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>We met each other while studying at McGill University and were placed together in the same apartment in the McGill Ghetto.</p><br>
            <p>As broke college students, we found ourselves cooking for each other and putting every last ingredient to good use.</p><br>
            <p>Our shared kitchen experiments led us to create a fun tradition of naming a “Head Chef” for the night.</p><br>
            <p>The "Head Chef" would plan the meal, lead the cooking, and share new tricks with the rest of the group.</p><br><br>
            <p>Eventually, we started venturing into baking, making everything from cookies and muffins to our own versions of French pastries.</p><br>
            <p>When our friends tasted our baked treats, they encouraged us to keep creating and even joked that we should open a bakery someday!</p><br>
            <p>Since then, our passion for baking has only grown. We decided to document our journey online and share it with the world.</p><br>
            <p>That's how Baker's Bliss was born,a place for us to share our love of baking and inspire others to create something delicious.</p>
